In Java, `this()` is a special method used to invoke another constructor of the same class from within a constructor. It is often used to avoid code duplication when multiple constructors in a class share some common initialization logic.

Here's how it works:

1. When you call `this()` inside a constructor, you're essentially calling another constructor of the same class.
2. This invocation must be the first statement in the constructor.
3. You can pass arguments to `this()` to select a specific constructor overload.
4. If you don't explicitly call `this()` or another constructor using `this()`, Java implicitly inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the superclass (`super()`).

Here's an example to illustrate:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    
    // Constructor with no arguments
    public MyClass() {
        this(0, 0); // Calls the constructor with two arguments
    }
    
    // Constructor with two arguments
    public MyClass(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    
    // Other methods of the class...
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass(); // Calls the no-argument constructor
        MyClass obj2 = new MyClass(10, 20); // Calls the two-argument constructor
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `MyClass()` constructor calls `this(0, 0)`, which in turn invokes the two-argument constructor, initializing `x` and `y` to 0.
- The `MyClass(int x, int y)` constructor initializes `x` and `y` with the provided arguments.

Using `this()` helps streamline your code by avoiding redundant initialization logic.
