Sure, here's a simple explanation of early binding and late binding in Java:

**Early Binding:**

- Also known as static binding.
- Occurs at compile time.
- The method to be executed is determined based on the type of reference variable.
- Resolves method calls at compile time.
- Mostly used in method overloading.
- Faster performance because the method is already determined at compile time.

**Late Binding:**

- Also known as dynamic binding or runtime polymorphism.
- Occurs at runtime.
- The method to be executed is determined based on the type of object.
- Resolves method calls at runtime.
- Mostly used in method overriding.
- Provides more flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented programming.
- Slightly slower performance compared to early binding due to method resolution at runtime.
