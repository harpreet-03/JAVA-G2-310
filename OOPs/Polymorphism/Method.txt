Certainly! Here's a breakdown of method overriding and overloading in Java, along with examples, presented in points:

**Method Overloading:**

1. **Definition:** Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters.
  
2. **Determined at Compile Time:** The method to be executed is determined by the compiler based on the number and type of arguments passed to it.

3. **Return Type Doesn't Matter:** Overloaded methods can have the same name and different return types, but the return type alone is not sufficient to differentiate methods during compilation.

4. **Examples:**

   ```java
   class Calculator {
       int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       double add(double a, double b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, there are two `add` methods with different parameter types (`int` and `double`), achieving method overloading.

**Method Overriding:**

1. **Definition:** Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

2. **Determined at Runtime:** The method to be executed is determined by the JVM based on the actual object type at runtime.

3. **Must Have Same Signature:** The overriding method must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the overridden method in the superclass.

4. **Examples:**

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, `Dog` class overrides the `sound` method of the `Animal` class. When you call `sound()` on a `Dog` object, it executes the `sound` method from the `Dog` class, demonstrating method overriding.

Both method overloading and overriding are essential features in Java that promote code reuse, enhance readability, and provide flexibility in designing object-oriented systems. They are extensively used in Java programming to achieve polymorphism and dynamic behavior.
