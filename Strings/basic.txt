String name = "Hello World"

In Java, `name` is a reference variable that refers to a string object with the value "Hello World". It's important to understand that in Java, objects are manipulated through references. So when you declare `String name = "Hello World";`, you're creating a string object with the value "Hello World" and `name` is referencing that object. This means `name` doesn't hold the actual string value, but rather a reference to where that value is stored in memory.

IMP POINTS: 

-> In java, Strings are an object that represents sequence of char values
-> In java, Strings are Immutable
-> Whenever we create a String in Java, the JVM checks the "String Constant Pool" first. If the String already exist in the pool, a refernece to the pool instance is returned.
If the String doesn't exist, a new String instance is created in the pool.
-> This makes Java Memory efficient bcz no new objects are created if it already exists in the String constant pool.
